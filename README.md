# Magic-Fighting-Simulator

Hi everyone working on this game. Here is the current plan for the game:

**Premise of the game:**

You can have 4 spells equipped at a time. Each spell is a spell book that follows you around (or maybe surrounds you). Like Weapon Fighting and Pet Sim, they will always be next to you (unlike Ant Army Sim where they are delayed behind you)

The spell books are closed books (bc it would look awkward if they were open and surrounded you).


The spell books are used to destroy some sort of food or enemy or something
Multiple people can destroy the same food

You get souls in return for destroying these - you can have an infinite inventory of these

You purchase new spell books in an altar - you get a random spell book out of 6

There are different areas which cost souls to get into.

There is also a second type of currency: crystals for now (might change later)
This can be used to buy magic upgrades - like more speed, more damage, etc…
More souls, more crystals

You can rank up - from novice sorcerer all the way to wizard to necromancer

We will have global leaderboards

Maybe a quest system

Probably a fusion system - fuse the same spell can make it stronger - 2 or 3 in order to fuse
Maybe level cap or not
Maybe there is certain level cap - but you can level up more with certain achievements or something
Same thing with storage

You can trade spells

There are relics that you can collect maybe - these might give you buffs or something
Need to think this thing through more
Relics have certain chance from being dropped by destroying certain food - different foods can give you different relics maybe
These probably won’t be visible - but you can equip them and they may do something
Like more damage, more exp

Achievement system - getting certain amount of food, getting certain amount of something, getting weapons
